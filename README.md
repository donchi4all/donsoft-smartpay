# Donsoft SmartPay

**Donsoft SmartPay** is a Laravel package that intelligently routes payment transactions to the most suitable payment processor based on configurable factors such as transaction cost, reliability, and currency support.

## Features
- **Multiple Payment Processor Support**: Supports different payment processors with configurable parameters.
- **Intelligent Routing**: Routes transactions to the best processor based on defined priorities (cost, reliability, currency support).
- **Customizable**: Easily add new processors or modify existing ones.
- **Extensible**: Allows developers to extend processors and define custom behavior.
  
## Installation

### 1. Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require donsoft/smartpay
```

### 2. Publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config --provider="Donsoft\\SmartPay\\Providers\\SmartPayServiceProvider"
```

This will create a `config/smartpay.php` file where you can configure your payment processors, priorities, and default settings.

### 3. Add Service Provider (for Laravel versions below 5.5):

If youâ€™re using a Laravel version below 5.5, add the following service provider to your `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    Donsoft\\SmartPay\\Providers\\SmartPayServiceProvider::class,
],
```

## Configuration

The configuration file `smartpay.php` allows you to define supported payment processors, the priority of routing factors, and more. Example configuration:

```php
return [
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Priority Weights for Payment Processor Selection
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    */
    'priorities' => [
        'currency_support' => 3,  // Most important
        'reliability' => 2,       // Second most important
        'transaction_cost' => 1,  // Least important
    ],

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Supported Payment Processors
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    */
    'processors' => [
        'processorA' => [
            'class' => \\Donsoft\\SmartPay\\Services\\Processors\\ProcessorA::class,
            'cost_per_transaction' => 0.5,
            'supported_currencies' => ['USD', 'EUR'],
            'min_transaction_amount' => 1,
            'reliability' => 0.85,
        ],
        'processorB' => [
            'class' => \\Donsoft\\SmartPay\\Services\\Processors\\ProcessorB::class,
            'cost_per_transaction' => 1.0,
            'supported_currencies' => ['USD'],
            'min_transaction_amount' => 100,
            'reliability' => 0.90,
        ],
    ],

    'default_currency' => 'USD',
];
```

## Usage

This is how to use **Donsoft SmartPay** in your Laravel project:

### 1. Inject the Payment Router into a Controller

You can inject the **PaymentRouter** service into your controller and use it to route transactions to the appropriate processor.

```php
use Donsoft\\SmartPay\\Services\\Routing\\PaymentRouter;
use Illuminate\\Http\\Request;

class PaymentController extends Controller
{
    protected $paymentRouter;

    public function __construct(PaymentRouter $paymentRouter)
    {
        $this->paymentRouter = $paymentRouter;
    }

    public function processPayment(Request $request)
    {
        $transaction = (object) [
            'amount' => $request->input('amount'),
            'currency' => $request->input('currency', config('smartpay.default_currency')),
        ];

        try {
            $processor = $this->paymentRouter->route($transaction);
            $response = $processor->process($transaction);

            return response()->json($response);
        } catch (\\Exception $e) {
            return response()->json(['status' => 'error', 'message' => $e->getMessage()], 400);
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Example Request to Process Payment:

```bash
POST /api/process-payment
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "amount": 150,
    "currency": "USD"
}
```

This will route the payment to the best processor based on the configuration and transaction details.

## Extending the Processor

You can add custom payment processors by extending the base processor class (**`BaseProcessor.php`**) and adding it to the configuration.

### Step 1: Create Your Custom Processor

```php
namespace App\\Services\\Processors;

use Donsoft\\SmartPay\\Services\\Processors\\BaseProcessor;

class CustomProcessor extends BaseProcessor
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct(
            'CustomProcessor',
            0.25,  // Cost per transaction
            ['USD', 'GBP'],  // Supported currencies
            0.95,  // Reliability
            10  // Minimum transaction amount
        );
    }

    public function process($transaction)
    {
        // Custom processing logic here
        return $this->successResponse($transaction);
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Add Your Processor to the Configuration

```php
return [
    'processors' => [
        'customProcessor' => [
            'class' => \\App\\Services\\Processors\\CustomProcessor::class,
            'cost_per_transaction' => 0.25,
            'supported_currencies' => ['USD', 'GBP'],
            'min_transaction_amount' => 10,
            'reliability' => 0.95,
        ],
    ],
];
```

Now, **CustomProcessor** will be included in the intelligent routing when a payment is processed.

## Customizing the Configuration

You can adjust the **priorities** and **processors** directly in the `smartpay.php` config file:

- **Priorities**: Adjust the weight of each factor in the routing decision (currency support, reliability, transaction cost).
  
- **Processors**: Define new or existing payment processors and their configurations (cost per transaction, supported currencies, minimum transaction amounts).

```php
'priorities' => [
    'currency_support' => 4,  // Higher priority
    'reliability' => 2,
    'transaction_cost' => 1,
],
```

## Running Tests

The package includes tests to verify its functionality. To run the tests:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Make sure your test classes are under the **`tests/`** directory.
